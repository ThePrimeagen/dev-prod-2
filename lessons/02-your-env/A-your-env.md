## The Environment
So for me, when i say environment what i mean is everything surrounding the
development process.

That means tmux, i3, vim, neovim, vscode, zed, core utils, etc etc

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## The most important starting place
to start is the hydration of your environment with all of your custom scripts,
your favorite utils, code editors, and other software

I am going to talk about a couple of tools that i have used in the past then we
are going to hand roll our own
