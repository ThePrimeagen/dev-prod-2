## The Environment
So for me, when i say environment what i mean is everything surrounding the
development process.
<br>
<br>

How you install your favorite libraries
<br>
How you interact with your operating system to get you where you want to be
<br>
How you arrange your windows
<br>
How you arrange your screens (desktops?)
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## The most important starting place
If you were given a brand new system how long does it take you set up?  I would
venture that most people spend a day getting ready to go followed by another
couple days patching the holes.
