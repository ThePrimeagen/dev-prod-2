## Supercharging your dev life
One of the best ways to dramatically increase the speed of what you are doing
is learning the posix ways and some of the tools out there to massively improve
your life

I cannot tell you how many times in my earlier life i wrote a program that one
small life of bash could have taken care of for me.  Just knowing your tools is
a massive advantage in developer life.
