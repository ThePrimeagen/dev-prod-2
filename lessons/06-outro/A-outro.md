## Why no AI?
there are two important reasons why i didn't go over AI in this course.
1. i see this rise of behavior in devs "learned helplessness"
1. the products are just moving so fast

## And this is it
Its the joy of making a better experience that helps keep me engaged as a dev.

## Important note
The most important thing about this course is not to do what I do, but to do
what _you_ want to do.  Now I emphasized the most important tools you can get
familiar with and their variations.  Learn, enjoy, and figure out what you
want.
