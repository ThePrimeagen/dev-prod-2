## The Terminal Experience
I have a list of things i want in my terminal to make it useful and it all is
centered around navigation.

### What I Want
1. sessions that last even when i close my terminal
1. multiple running sessions, and these sessions are based on directory
1. "tabs" within a session
1. navigate to any session by directory name "instantly"
1. navigate to any session by directory with fuzzy find
1. run scripts or whatever programs i want when navigating to a directory

## I Choose Tmux
I personally use tmux + ghostty, though i hear wezterm, another terminal
emulator, you can emulate pretty much every way I use tmux.  I have not used
wezterm so i cannot speak much about it. Zellij has similar experience but more
modern

## Quick Notes
* About 3 years ago I did the first version of Dev productivity and some things
  about my setup has changed, and parts have remained the same.  After 3 years,
  this is still my most useful script I have ever created.  But i have added
  some significant improvements to the script

## Installing TMUX
| Platform                    | Install Command         |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Arch Linux                  | `pacman -S tmux`        |
| Debian or Ubuntu            | `apt install tmux`      |
| Fedora                      | `dnf install tmux`      |
| RHEL or CentOS              | `yum install tmux`      |
| macOS (using Homebrew)      | `brew install tmux`     |
| macOS (using MacPorts)      | `port install tmux`     |
| openSUSE                    | `zypper install tmux`   |

### Base Config
Here is the basic config that will make life easier.  This will ensure that you
have a similar experience to me

```bash
set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color"
set -s escape-time 0
set -g base-index 1

# optional -- i like C-a not C-b (pure preference)
unbind C-b
set-option -g prefix C-a
bind-key C-a send-prefix

# <WHERE YOUR TMUX CONF GOES> = XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmux/tmux.conf
# <WHERE YOUR TMUX CONF GOES> = ~/.tmux.conf
bind r source-file <WHERE YOUR TMUX CONF GOES> \; display-message "tmux.conf reloaded"
```

### Install it via our dev-env!
We can even use our fancy new dev-env script to install it!

## Lets navigate tmux
Lets go through some basic commands about tmux so you can see how they work
with just usage.  I will show you the ones I use and some that I don't use

* what is prefix key
* creating window
* detaching
* attaching
* showing all running sessions
* killing pane / window / session
* creating and navigating splits
    * tmux is controlled by a config

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## A bit of customization
I like to navigate my tmux panes like i navigate my vim windows

lets try this out:

```bash
# Add to your tmux.conf file
bind -r h select-pane -L
bind -r j select-pane -D
bind -r k select-pane -U
bind -r l select-pane -R
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Based on my previous 5 points, only two have been met.
> 1. sessions that last even when i close my terminal
> 3. "tabs" within a session

<br>
<br>

It turns out that `tmux` is also scriptable!  And its quite fantastic

<br>
<br>
<br>

## The Session API

A `target` is a tuple of `<session_name>[:<widx>|<wname>[.<pane_idx>]]`

```bash
tmux new-session -s <sname> -n <initial wname> -d[etach]
tmux list-sessions
tmux attach-session -t <target>
tmux has-session -t <target> # don't forget -t vs -t=
tmux switch-client -t <target>
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## The Window API

```bash
tmux new-window -n <name> [-t session:window_index]
tmux list-windows [-t session]
tmux select-window -t session:[window_idx | window_name].[pane_idx]
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Other fun apis

```bash
tmux send-keys -t <target> "text" [ctrl keys,...]
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Lets start with our first script
From my original points, we still have 4 points left to address to create the
"perfect" navigation system for the terminal

### What I Want
1. DONE :: sessions that last even when i close my terminal
1. multiple running sessions, and these sessions are based on directory
1. DONE :: "tabs" within a session
1. navigate to any session by directory name "instantly"
1. navigate to any session by directory with fuzzy find
1. run scripts or whatever programs i want when navigating to a directory

## Lets Address Point 6 First
This is one of the easier points to address

* opens and creates the configuration you want for a project

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Opener script

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

if [[ -x ./.ready-tmux ]]; then
    ./.ready-tmux
elif [[ -x ~/.ready-tmux ]]; then
    ~/.ready-tmux
fi
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Thats pretty cool?
That was pretty awesome that we can create all the windows / splits we want
with a simple script (don't worry, it'll get a lot better)

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Progress
We have checked off another component of what I consider a great terminal
experience

> 6. run scripts or whatever programs i want when navigating to a directory

But we still have a few left

> 2. multiple running sessions, and these sessions are based on directory
> 4. navigate to any session by directory name "instantly"
> 5. navigate to any session by directory with fuzzy find

<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Detour time
FZF is an incredible tool for fuzzy finding.  Its not just for finding
directories.  You can fuzzy find on anything you pass in and is often used
within text editors.

### I will add fzf to my scripts

`dev-env/runs/libs`
```bash
# ... other libs i install ...

git clone git@github.com:junegunn/fzf.git $HOME/personal/fzf
$HOME/personal/fzf/install
```

`dev-env/env/.zsh_profile`
```bash
## All that sweet sweet fzf
[ -f ~/.fzf.zsh ] && source ~/.fzf.zsh
```

### Execute
Make sure i only run my libs script
`run --dry libs`

Run my lib script
`run libs`

Copy all of my files over
`dev-env`

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Test run
try pressing `C-r` (Control + r) and it should bring up a beautiful fuzzy find
comparatively to your standard `C-r` from the terminal

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Playing with FZF

input
```bash
➜  dev-prod-2 git:(main) ✗ echo "1\n2\n3" | fzf
```

output
```bash
  3
  2
▌ 1
  3/3 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
>
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Lets solve the last problems
> 2. multiple running sessions, and these sessions are based on directory
> 4. navigate to any session by directory name "instantly"
> 5. navigate to any session by directory with fuzzy find

### Some notes
* We don't want to search _every_ directory on the file system, we want to have
some sort of subset.

* We want to navigate based on the results of FZF

### CODE TIME!!
Lets start this MF script (MF = Mother FZF):
* get a selected directory from fzf.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Expected Code
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

selected=$(find ~/personal -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d | fzf)
echo "selected!! $selected"
```

### Ok, lets do some great things
* is there a running session given name
  * `:,.` are not allowed as session name
  * ` ` we should also remove spaces... but if you use a space in your directory name i dislike you
  * there are other non allowed characters, but we will not worry about them
* if there is, navigate to that session
* if there is not, create that session and navigate to it

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Expected Code

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

selected=$(find ~/personal ~/ ~/.config -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d | fzf)
if [[ -z "$selected" ]]; then
    exit 0
fi
selected_name=$(basename "$selected" | tr ",.: " "____")

if tmux has-session -t=$selected_name 2> /dev/null; then
    tmux switch-client -t=$selected_name
    exit 0
fi

if [[ -z "$TMUX" ]]; then
    tmux new-session -s $selected_name -c $selected
    exit 0
fi

tmux new-session -ds $selected_name -c $selected
tmux switch-client -t $selected_name
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Combine our two scripts
It would be nice if we could combine our two scripts...

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Next Expected Script
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

selected=$(find ~/personal ~/ ~/.config -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d | fzf)
if [[ -z "$selected" ]]; then
    exit 0
fi
selected_name=$(basename "$selected" | tr ",.: " "____")

if tmux has-session -t=$selected_name 2> /dev/null; then
    tmux switch-client -t=$selected_name
    exit 0
fi

if [[ -z "$TMUX" ]]; then
    tmux new-session -s $selected_name -c $selected
else
    tmux new-session -ds $selected_name -c $selected
    tmux switch-client -t $selected_name
fi
tmux send-keys -t $selected_name "ready-tmux"
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## How do i execute this?
* we copy it to a $PATH location
* we can create a tmux shortcut to execute it
