## The Goal
My approach to _my environment_.

or as i like to say: there isn't a right way, but there is my way and its
pretty good.  I only have one thing I optimize which is productivity.

> BUT WHAT ABOUT i3-gaps, WHAT ABOUT ALL THE RICES

Honestly, I don't care.  I just don't care at all.  I just want to get where i
want to be in the fewest amount of keystrokes

## A bit of prereq
One thing that should be apparent is that i will be approaching this class from
a unix perspective.

Its not that i don't think windows is good for dev, its just I never use it for
anything but games.
